This is a landing page of the NAMU. There're a header with a menu, a main title, a logo, a link and language selector; a main block with some sections presenting events, exhibitions and news. The page also has a form with an email input. A footer of the landing page contains, opening hours, social media links, contacts, a navigation and copyrights.

I used such technologies as HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM to create this landing page.
